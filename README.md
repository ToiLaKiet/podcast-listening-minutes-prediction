# podcast-listening-minutes-prediction
A competition of playground series from Kaggle. I have learned to employ a XG Boost model. And this is insightful for me about podcasts data and stuff

:)) but the performance is very poor. this is my first competition finished

this work lacks deeper feature insights. i think i did not perform well in combining features together or making the features become more meaningful
